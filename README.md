This is a React plugin (built in **2018**) for the freeCodeCamp Test Suite.

## How To Use

First,  
* Run `npm install react-fcctest ` in the terminal  

Then, 
* Place `import React_fCCtest from 'react-fcctest';`  
  at the head of your React application homepage

That is all there is to it!

> This open source project was built out of admiration for freeCodeCamp. Teaching people to code globally is a great mission! Try to change the world, one line of code at a time.
